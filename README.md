# SOC
##**Space Optimization For COVID-19 Wards**

###Welcome! :wave:


@KieranNg and I are Mathematical Science students from NTU under SPMS.<br/>
We are working on a project for SCOPE Odyessey. We are trying to optimize a given ward space and equally divide them into subsections.<br/>


Listed below are the main features of SOC:
'''
- [Voronoi Events](https://github.com/charutomo/SOC/blob/Renderer/VoronoiEvent.py)
- [Rooms](https://github.com/charutomo/SOC/blob/Renderer/room.py)
- [Circumcircle](https://github.com/charutomo/SOC/blob/BST_Queue/Circumcircle%20Coefficients.py)
'''

Our report will be released on later date.<br/>
Thank you.
