## Introduction
[@KieranNg](https://github.com/KieranNg) and I are Mathematical Science students from NTU under SPMS.
We are working on Space Optimisation: A qualitative project on how to isolate patients in a given setting for SCOPE Odyssey. We are trying to optimize a given ward space and equally divide them into subsections.<br/>
